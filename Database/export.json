After two legislative sessions of virtual meetings, we&#x27;re delighted to return to our Capitol building and meet with legislative offices in person. Mark your calendar and make plans to be in Austin on Monday, March 31 for Cyclists in Suits 2025 – Texas’ Bike Lobby Day.</p><p></p><p>In the course of one day, people who ride bikes from around the state will meet with every legislative office to tell them about our bills, what people who bike, walk, and use other active transportation in Texas need from their elected officials, and address concerns they may have. In the past, we’ve heard about bad bills and been able to take action immediately just from talking to staffers in legislative offices, and we’ve moved the needle on important legislation with an in-person visit.</p><p></p><p>To make it all happen, we need <em>you!</em> <a href=\"https://biketexas.formstack.com/forms/cyclists_in_suits_2025\">Register now for Cyclists in Suits</a> and start planning your trip.</p><p></p><p>If you’re coming in from outside of Austin and would like to organize a bus or carpool from your area, let us know so we can connect you with other advocates coming from your direction.</p><p></p><p>Here’s a tentative schedule of the day:</p><ul><li>7:30am | Pre-meeting at BikeTexas – please be on time! (<a href=\"https://maps.app.goo.gl/qZE4cmqH7kEkvnf99\">900 Springdale Rd., Austin, TX 78702</a>) We’ll have coffee and bagels waiting for you.</li><li>9:00am | Wheels down – we’ll bike as a group to the Capitol (other transportation arrangements will be made in the event of bad weather).</li><li>9:30am – 3:00pm | Lobby teams will meet with their assigned legislative offices. We’ll visit each office at the Capitol during the course of the day.</li><li>11:30am – 1:00pm | Take team lunch breaks in the Capitol cafeteria (along with lobbyists, staffers, etc.) between office visits during this time window. Please budget $15-$20 for lunch.</li><li>3:00pm | Group picture on the Capitol steps.</li><li>3:30pm | Ride back to BikeTexas.</li><li>4:00 – 6:00pm | Share meeting notes and observations with fellow attendees and celebrate with light refreshments!</li></ul>",

We have so much to discuss that's coming up in 2025, most importantly parking reform and the 2025 Council elections. That Thursday is also when the City Plan Commission will re-hear the Pepper Square zoning case. You can make plans to speak at City Hall and then catch the bus to Far-Out to debrief! Far-Out can be reached by the DART 18 bus which runs from downtown every 15 minutes. There is also parking available on-site.",

      "description": "Join us to give public comment in favor of Parking Reform in Dallas on December 5th at the City Plan Commission! Dallas could follow the lead of cities like Austin, San Jose, and Minneapolis and get rid of destructive parking mandates citywide. These mandates mean that we build too much parking, making our cities more expensive and less livable. The inefficient use of space from parking means the heat island effect is worse, makes neighborhoods accessible only by car, and drives up the cost of housing. The current proposal does other great things like limiting curb-cuts, pushing parking to the rear or side of buildings, and creating guidelines for pedestrian accessibility. To sign up to speak, you can register on the city website at this link. Sign up to speak on Item 25. You can speak either virtually or in-person. We expect for public comment to begin at about 5:30 PM, though that is just a best guess. Never given public comment before and want help? Join our Zoom Tuesday, December 3rd from 7-8 PM. Click on this Zoom link to join!",

      "description": "Dallas currently is crafting its 2024 bond. Historically, housing has received little funding by the city. But this bond is an opportunity to change that. We are going to be at the 6:30 PM August 15th Community Bond Task Force Meeting in conjunction with the Dallas Housing Coalition to advocate for $200 million for affordable housing in the bond. We want this to be an overwhelming show of support, and we hope to see you on the 15th! Click the link to sign up to speak either virtually or in-person.August is Membership Month at YIMBYAction, our parent organization. Speaking on the 15th gets you free membership for a year with YIMBYAction along with a free T-Shirt. If you can't speak on the 15th, you can also speak at the Community Bond Task Force meeting on the 22nd, but our main group will be going on the 15th. RSVPing helps us keep track of who speaks and receives the YIMBYAction membership. If you've never spoken before at a public meeting, this is a perfect one to advocate for housing! There will be lots of fellow pro-housing speakers there, and it's in the evening too. We recommend making your speech about the need for affordable housing as personal as possible, but below are some general ideas and stats (many courtesy of Dallas Housing Coalition) that you can use. Note, you can either prepare something to say or speak extemporaneously.- Dallas needs 100,000 new or refurbished affordable homes by 2033 to meet our housing demand.- San Antonio ($150 million) and Austin ($350 million) both passed by a large majority significant affordable housing bonds in 2022.- Dallas lost 38,000 homes valued around $100,000, the kind of home most affordable for first time homebuyers, in the past five years.- Studies have shown that new affordable housing in a neighborhood is correlated with a decrease in crime in the area. - $200 million could fund the creation of thousands of affordable units.- Higher cost of housing is tied to increased homelessness, heightening the need for funding to help fight homelessness.- Since 2010, Dallas has delivered only 1.9 new, deed-restricted affordable\nunits per 1,000 residents, ranking 21st of 32 big cities in the affordable unit production.- Dallas ranks 10th out of the 12 largest cities for affordable housing units in “high opportunity” census tracts and remains the\nmost segregated big city in Texas – and among the most segregated big cities in the nation.\n - Lack of housing affordability forces families to make tradeoffs with basic daily needs (e.g. food, clothing, transportation). On\naverage, families at or below 50% AMI are spending nearly half their income on housing each month.",

      "description": "August is Membership Month at YIMBYAction, our parent organization. To get free membership for a year with YIMBYAction and receive a free T-Shirt, there are THREE opportunities to advocate for housing. You only need to speak at one of the three for the T-Shirt and membership. Note, you can speak either virtually or in-person. The other two opportunities will be the Community Bond Task Force Meetings on August 15th and 22nd at 6:30 PM. Stay tuned for more info on those dates. The first opportunity is this Thursday!Thursday August 3rd CPC Meeting at 12:30 PM in Support of Walnut Hill Rezoning: Link to sign up to Speak for Item 8: 23-2037 - Z212-307(RM).This case got delayed from the July 20th meeting City Plan Commission (CPC) meeting. The rezoning is to allow TOD (Transit-Oriented Development) on what is currently a shopping center at The Hill, close to the Walnut Hill DART station. If approved, the rezoning would allow for up to 1,700 homes, of which more than 150 would be affordable. Read more about the case.The CPC meeting starts at 12:30. Since the rezoning is for Item 8, it could be heard around 1 PM but it is impossible to say for sure. Unless you are free for all of Thursday afternoon, we recommend speaking virtually because of the time uncertainty. You will be able to join the meeting virtually here. NOTE: If you can't speak Thursday, you can submit a public comment in support here. You can select every Commissioner, and again it is Item 8: 23-2037 - Z212-307(RM). Feel free to use the language below when submitting your comment or for preparing to speak.\"Hello, I'm here to speak in favor of this rezoning. I'm excited to see this proposal to build a mixed-use community in what is currently simply a commercial area. It's even better that this rezoning is close to the Walnut Hill DART station. This kind of Transit-Oriented Development is something that we don't have enough of here in Dallas, but it's exactly what we need in order to be a better city. Building up to 1,700 homes where there are currently none will help make Dallas more affordable for all, help environmentally by increasing public transit ridership and reducing sprawl, decrease displacement of existing residents, and create increased tax revenue to provide for better public services in Dallas. I hope that you not only approve the rezoning today but also look at how the city can proactively rezone other areas around DART stations to spur this kind of development.\"",

The night before the vote, help us flip the future of South Dallas by joining for a night of food, music, and art. Come out to the Southern Classic Daiquiri Factory in the shadow of I-345 starting at 7 PM for what promises to be a special night. Residents of neighborhoods paved over by highways across Dallas will join us as we envision what a future with I-345 replaced. Speaking will be Dallas Civil Rights Legend Peter Johnson, Friendship West Reverend David McGruder, and Dallas Truth, Racial Healing & Transformation Executive Director Jerry Hawkins. Our vision for replacing I-345 is rooted in community, and this is our chance right before the vote to make our voices heard.2. Sign up to speak and attend the May 24th City Council Meeting. You can't sign up for the 24th until May 18th. It is essential for council to hear us on the actual day of the vote. You will be able to speak either virtually or in-person about I-345. We will update with more info when the agenda for the 24th is posted. RSVP to make sure you get a reminder to sign up to speak! More information about I-345Sign our I-345 Petition",

We will be at Oak Cliff Brewing Company from 6-8 PM on Tuesday, April 18th writing letters to apartment voters in D1, D2, and D6 reminding them to vote. Chad West, Jesse Moreno, and Omar Narvaez will also be there, so this is a great opportunity to meet your council member. Rumor has it that there might even be a free drink for anyone that shows up...Turnout in City Council elections is historically very low, and taking an hour or two can make a big difference in an election. Looking forward to seeing you on Tuesday evening for a fun night.",

Parking policies guide much of the form and design of our cities. They entrap cities in a cycle of car-dependency that has negative impacts on housing costs, carbon emissions, air quality, and city budget. Important conversations are happening in Dallas around parking reform, with City Council expected to vote on a new parking policy in early 2025.This evening will be a great primer on the real life impacts of parking policies. So whether you've never parked a car in your life or if you've read the Dallas City parking requirements front to back, this is a great opportunity for anyone to learn more about a subject that is critical to the future of our city.RSVP to receive the Zoom link for the event.",

      "description": "LOCATION CHANGE: We hope you can join us on August 24th at FOUR CORNERS BREWERY to hear about what the future of housing in Dallas could look like. We have three amazing panelists who together know more about Dallas housing than anyone. They will talk about the current challenges facing housing in Dallas, as well as what we can do to make housing in Dallas affordable and abundant for all. Whether you are an expert or know nothing about housing in Dallas, you are sure to learn a lot from our three panelists. Paul Carden is a VP at Venture Commercial, specializing in urban real estate and zoning. He is playing a key role in the development of the Southern Gateway Park.Dr. Andreea Udrea is the Assistant Director of Planning and Urban Design at the city of Dallas. She is on a mission to bring parking reform to Dallas. Tony Shidid is the Chair of the City Plan Commission and the Chair of the Economic Development and Housing Bond Subcommittee fighting for affordable housing in the 2024 bond. The location change is because of a potential space issue due to the high level of interest for the event. We will be inside next door to the main Tap Room. Four Corners Brewery is located in the Cedars, and it is a 7 minute walk from the Cedars DART station. You can also take the 13 or 308 DART bus to within a minute walk. Parking is available as well.",

Ashley will be going over the findings of CPAL's \"Rental Housing Needs Assessment\" report for the city of Dallas. The report is full of incredible data and graphics, and you can read it in full here. Unlike many other reports, it focuses specifically on the city of Dallas, giving a clearer picture of the housing picture in the city. Please RSVP to receive the Zoom link for the meeting. You will receive the link then, and we will be sure to send an email reminder with it as well.",

      "description": "Our February meeting will feature Zach Krochtengel of Sycamore Strategies, a LIHTC (Low-income Housing Tax Credit) developer in Dallas. Krochtengel is currently developing several complexes in northern Dallas, including at Forest Lane and rehabbing the historic Cabana Hotel. Our conversation will focus on the differences between affordable housing (often older market-rate units) and Affordable Housing (income-restricted units with public subsidy), the challenges in building new Affordable Housing, and what Dallas can do to build more Affordable Housing.Dallas ranks low in terms of big cities that have created new Affordable units in recent years. Our meeting will happen one week before City Council votes on the 2024, which could potentially include a historic investment in Affordable Housing. We will include time for Q&A, so make sure to bring some questions. We will be upstairs at Union (https://www.uniondallas.org/) in Oak Lawn. Heads up, unfortunately the upstairs area is not wheel-chair accessible. Coffee/drinks will be available to buy, and we will have snacks available as well for free. You can take the DART bus 103 or 23 routes, and parking will be available on-site. Looking forward to seeing you on February 7th!",

Join us there to hear from Patrick Kennedy (Space Between Design Founder and DART Board Member), Julia Ryan (Director of Dallas Planning and Urban Design), and Tamela Thornton (Executive Director of Urban Land Institute Dallas-Ft. Worth) about the past 25 years of Dallas Urbanism. The event is at 6:30, and you can join us either before starting at 6:15 PM or after the talk is over at the Angelika's cafe to discuss all things housing and urbanism in Dallas. We encourage you to take DART, either by train or bus, especially if you plan on drinking at all. The Angelika is accessible by the Blue, Orange, and Red DART train lines. However, there is parking available as well.",

Whether you are a \"kid\" or someone of an older makeup, come on out to enjoy a beer and conversation in downtown. The June social has no agenda and is all about meeting with other people trying to fight for more housing in Dallas. Of course, you can expect topics like Forward Dallas to be part of the conversation. Also come out to hear our plans to grow as a group and take our advocacy to the next level.The Brewery is easiest to get to using DART. You can get out at the Akard Station using any of the rail lines or use any of the bus lines that go through downtown. Pegasus City Brewery will validate parking at the lot at 1114 St.",

This is the rare chance where public comment is being taken in the evening, instead of during the weekday. And we need to PACK City Hall with the everyday Dallas resident who would benefit from a pro-housing Forward Dallas but normally is left out of the conversations at City Hall. We are going to make this a PARTY, not just your normal public comment meeting. Here's the plan. From 5-6 PM (the pregame) we will be in the Flag Room outside of the council chambers before heading into the council chambers (aka the club) to support each other making killer arguments for more housing in Dallas.Specifically, we are fighting for a Forward Dallas that advocates for 1. A Community Residential Placetype that accommodates more housing within single-family neighborhoods.2. An emphasis on Mixed-Use and more housing in commercial and formerly industrial areas. 3. ADUs by right across Dallas neighborhoods.Read more about Forward Dallas here: https://www.dallasneighborsforhousing.org/forward-dallas.\n\n\t  \n\t      \n\t      \n          This event is accessible",

      "description": "On Wednesday, May 11th, Dallas City Council will consider whether to adopt the One Dallas Options plan. One Dallas Options expands the current mixed-income housing development bonus program by allowing developers to reduce in parking in exchange for including affordable units on-site or by paying a fee in-lieu that the city would use to fund affordable housing programs citywide. These are all opt-in, no-cost programs for the city and involve no tax abatements. You can read more about the program here.We are excited to do our FIRST housing advocacy action at City Hall in Support of One Dallas Option during the May 11th council meeting. To speak during the meeting, either virtually or in-person, you must call the City Secretary's office at (214) 670-3738 by 5:00 p.m on Tuesday, May 10th and ask to speak on Item 41 (which relates to several parts of One Dallas Options). Item 41 speakers should start somewhere around 10:00 AM, but it is impossible to say exactly when.If you are speaking in-person on the 11th, Chapter Lead, Adam Lamont, will be at City Hall at 9:00 AM. Please send Adam a text at 469-783-3381 when you get to City Hall so that you can meet up.Speaking at council meetings can make a huge impact! Adam spoke at the briefing on April 20th, and some of his comments ended up making the news! If you are thinking about speaking on May 11th and would like some additional support, we are going to have a virtual prep meeting on Monday, May 9th from 6:30-7:30 PM. The goal of the meeting is to help brainstorm for the speeches and give some best practices. LFG!Your neighbors,Adam, DeDe, Hosanna, and Chris",

      "description": "We need to speak up for housing on December 6th at 9 AM at City Council! There are two huge housing issues that council will be hearing about, and we need to PACK the room with housing advocates. To sign up to speak, go to https://dallascityhall.com/government/citysecretary/pages/ccrules.aspx or call 214-670-3738 to sign up. You can speak virtually or in-person, but we recommend speaking in-person if possible. Haven't spoken before at council and want advice on what to say? RSVP and join us for a Zoom on November 29th at 7:00 PM. The first and most pressing issue on December 6th is the 2024 Bond. We, as part of the broader Dallas Housing Coalition, have been asking for $200 million for affordable housing in the bond. The Community Bond Task Force has slashed that amount to less than $50 million. That is unacceptable in a housing crisis. December 6th will have Council hear proposals from the City Manager and the Bond Task Force on the bond for the first time. The good news is that members of city council have indicated already that they want more money for housing. Now, we have to make them follow through on that and make sure they hear us loud and clear on the 6th.The other issue is Minimum Lot Size reform and legalizing missing middle housing. Council is having an initial hearing from staff about what these reforms could do. It's an important step in these reforms coming to council for a vote, hopefully in the near future. Note, that something like minimum lot size reform would make the housing bond more effective by making any housing built be more efficient. December 6th is the kind of day why Dallas Neighbors for Housing exists. We know that speaking at City Council on a weekday morning favors those capable of making the time instead of working, but we have to play the game. Speaking, or at least showing up to support, does make a big difference. You also can send an email to City Council here: https://actionnetwork.org/letters/dallas-city-council-prioritize-affordable-housing.",

      "description": "Join Neighbors for More Neighbors - Dallas for our FIRST in-person meeting on Thursday, April 7th from 6:30-8:00 PM at People's Last Stand at Mockingbird Station! We will have a very special guest in Dallas city planner Pam Thompson who is primarily responsible for the policy changes. Our meeting will focus on the proposed One Dallas Options.  According the city of Dallas, \"The idea behind One Dallas is to develop a menu of incentive options – additional development rights, reimbursement of development fees, parking reductions, etc. – in exchange for on-site provision of mixed income units, off-site provision, or a fee in lieu of provision.\" The ordinance is expected to be voted on by City Council in May. Pam Thompson will talk to us about the policy and take any questions that we have. Finally, we will talk about going as a group to the city council meeting to advocate for the proposed changes and improvements to the policy we want! Come on out for a good time with fellow neighbors advocating for more neighbors and a better, more livable Dallas! We can't wait to have a drink (alcoholic or non-alcoholic) with you on April 7th! We encourage everyone to take DART to Mockingbird Station for the meeting if possible!",

There is no good reason to remove Plano's bus routes. To be clear, we can and should be supportive or neutral to citywide GoLink. We oppose removal of DART bus services in Plano.<br><br>You have to register to leave a public comment prior to the board meeting. Registration is done in person. We encourage Plano residents to prioritize speaking to their council about this issue. Non-Plano residents should prioritize the board meeting.<br>",

      "description": "At the first citywide Forward Dallas meeting, pro-housing advocates outnumbered those trying to keep the status quo (https://candysdirt.com/2024/04/22/activists-come-out-swinging-on-both-sides-of-forwarddallas-comprehensive-land-use-plan/). But we can expect for lots more people to show up on May 9th. So join us once again at City Hall again on May 9th from 6-9 PM.This is the rare chance where public comment is being taken in the evening, instead of during the weekday. For this meeting, no online registration is required if you are speaking in person. If you can't make it in person and plan on speaking virtually, you can register here starting on Friday, May 3rd. If you've never given a public comment before, don't be intimidated! Showing up and telling your truth around housing is what matters the most. Specifically, we are fighting for a Forward Dallas that advocates for 1. A Community Residential Placetype that accommodates more housing within single-family neighborhoods.2. An emphasis on Mixed-Use and more housing in commercial and formerly industrial areas. 3. ADUs by right across Dallas neighborhoods.Read more about Forward Dallas here: https://www.dallasneighborsforhousing.org/forward-dallas.\n\n\t  \n\t      \n\t      \n          This event is accessible",

The bills range from good (increased funding for Affordable Housing and allowing ADUs by-right) to bad (decreased tenants rights), and it can be hard to understand everything that is being considered. To discuss the different bills, we are hosting two experts: Felicity Maxwell, the Executive Director of Texans for Housing, and Ben Martin, the Research Director for Texas Housers. Texans for Housing focuses on removing barriers to building housing while Texas Housers focuses on tenants rights and expanding access to affordable housing. The event will be fully virtual on Zoom.

      "description": "Join members of (re)Place 345 in Austin on August 30th for a public demonstration and to give testimony at TxDOT's (Texas Department of Transportation) monthly meeting. This is the last meeting to give comment on TxDOT's proposed 10 year budget plan. We are joining other freeway fighting groups from across the state for this protest. A lot of media will be there so this is a FANTASTIC way to make clear Dallas residents want to (re)Place 345. Importantly, the $1 billion I-345 hybrid proposal is NOT currently in the budget. Tell TxDOT that they should NOT add another $1 billion dollar project to the budget and instead allow for further study to the a boulevard option for 345. Need a ride to Austin? WE GOT YOU! Email us at moreneighborsdallas@gmail.com and we can coordinate. Our plan is to head down early morning on Tuesday and return to Dallas in the afternoon/evening. Breakfast and lunch will be provided.",
